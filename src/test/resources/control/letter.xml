         <h1>Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh</h1>
      </div>
      <div>My dear Theo</div>
      <div>What a good day we spent together, one we shall certainly remember. I want to make sure that you find a letter when you return from Etten. You’ll certainly have had a good time at home, write soon to say how you spent the day.</div>
      <div>Herewith you receive something for your portfolio, namely a lithograph after J. Maris, beneath which one might write: a poor man in the kingdom of God, and a lithograph after Mollinger. Had you seen this one before? I hadn’t. From a Jewish bookseller, who gets me the Latin and Greek books I need, I had the opportunity of choosing what I wanted from a large batch, and not at all expensive, 13 for 70 cents. Thought I’d take several for my room, to give it some atmosphere, which is necessary to get and refresh ideas.</div>
      <div>I’ll give you a list, then you’ll know what it looks like and what’s hanging there.</div>
      <div>Your most loving brother, Vincent</div>
